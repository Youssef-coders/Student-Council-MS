      <h4>TEACHER VS STUDENT MATCH EMBARRASSMENT</h4>
      <p>
        A crazy game happened Sunday 5th of October as teachers and students 
        embark on a tradition of a football match. It was an AMAZING game where
         the teachers DESTROYED the students. The game ended on 8/1 for the teachers with the MVP's
          being Mr. Abdulrahman and Mr. Rayan. The teachers defenders were too good for the students,
           although the students did have some good players like Abdulhadi the defender.
      </p>
      
      <h4>9AM2 WORST PERFORMING TEAM IN THE LEAGUE</h4>
      <p>
        The match was CATASTROPHIC FOR 9am2. As in the 47th minute, Saif scored the 2 goals for 9am1, 
        followed by another 2 by Ziad and Fahad. In the 60th and 63rd minute both Fahad and Said scored, 
        followed by Waleed scoring 2, in the 78th minute and Saif scoring in the 95th minute. The Man of 
        the match award goes to Saif Alden for scoring 4 goals and 2 assists. 9am1 won with a score of 9/0.
      </p>
      <p>Special Congratulations to Saif AL-DIEN AND Abdulhadi for their amazing performances</p>
